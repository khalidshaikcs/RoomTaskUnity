2)	By default camera rotation is disabled because it makes difficult to click the target points when camera rotation is there.
3)	Right Click mouse to enable or disable the camera rotation.

4)	Click on any target points which are glowing to move the character at that point.
5)	Colliders are not added for the props inside the room, hence the player passes through the props.
6)	I have added colliders to walls so that player can not move outside of the room.
